CLEANING DATA (week 5)
- check for missing data - Richard


SEGMENT DATA (week 5)
- automatic classification of rural vs urban - Richard


INITIAL LINEAR MODELING (week 5)
- experiment different Generalized Linear Models - Courtney
	- write function to train data, validate, and plot - Courtney
- try different feature / label pairs (total pollution index vs. poverty levels) (rural) + plot - Akwasi
- feature selection (NN) - Richard


COMPARE OTHER MODELS
- SVM - Courtney
- Neural Network - Courtney


MOSES' ADVICE:
- start with simple algorithm (i.e. Naive Bayes)
- build intuition: when does algorithm work well? what are cases where it has issues?
- then focus on problematic cases
